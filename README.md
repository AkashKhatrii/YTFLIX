## Contributing
Anyone can add content links by clicking the plus icon available at the navbar in the site, sending both the title and url at https://ytflix.netlify.app/
Or directly sending pull requests to the Dev branch with updated links.
## Future
An new Category "Originals" is to be added in the upcoming releases containing a list of Officially Released Content on YouTube, such as the movie "Samadhi", "AlphaGo", "PodCasts" & documentaries.

## Notice
The Bulma Branch is a lighter implementation of ytflix, but is still considered to be unstable, do not fork the main branch then merge into Bulma or vice versa. It creates massive inconsistencies. Only Branch to be forked is the Dev Branch.

The Dev Branch is the one to create pull requests at. It is live at
